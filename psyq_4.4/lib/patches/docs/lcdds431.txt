                Libcd, libds version 4.3.1(bug-fixed version)

Libcd(.lib, .a) and Libds(.lib, .a) will be released. The following 
malfunctions have been fixed in this version.
Please replace both libraries together with the new ones although Libcd 
and Libds are not dependent on each other.


[Changes]
Libcd
- The type of the pause command issued at the end of the read by CdRead()
  or CdReadSync() has been changed from blocking to non-blocking.
- CdReadSync() recognizes the end of the pause command as the read end.

Libds
- In DsRead() command queue is cleared before performing a retry.
- When the previous command is pause and completes normally, the pause 
  command is not issued, and replaced with the nop instead.
