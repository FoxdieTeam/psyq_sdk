                Libpad version 4.3.1(bug-fixed version)

Libpad(.lib, .a) will be released. The following malfunction has been 
fixed in this version.

[Symptom]
- An controller might not be identified, or an invalid value might be
  returned by libpad functions. (Those cases mostly happen after half way
  insertion of controller connectors.)

[Note]
- Compared with the version 4.3, it takes about double time for the return
  value of PadGetState() to become steady after a controller is inserted. 
  Please keep it in mind if time-out is set. 
- Please use this version in combination with libapi version 4.2 or later.
